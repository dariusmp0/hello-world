My first repository

Hello friends,

I  aspire to be a competent web developer and programmer. Having a long held interest in computers, computing and the internet, I am looking to develop the skills necessary to contribute to and be part of the ever growing digital universe.

I am looking to learn the following technologies:

c </br>
python </br>
HTML5 and CSS3 </br>
java-script </br>
php

Always looking for pointers. So if anyone has any constructive
suggestions I can be reached at dariusmp0@gmail.com. Thanks.
