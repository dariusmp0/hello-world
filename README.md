My first repository

Hello friends,

I am in a half-way house in Los Angeles after serving time for the stupid things I do when I get drunk. 
I need to find better ways to make use of my time than drinking and this is what I came up with.
While I was at San Quentin they had a coding program https://thelastmile.org. I never had an opportunity to apply.
Now I am taking my rehabilitation into my own hands. Always looking for pointers. So if anyone has any constructive
suggestions I can be reached at dariusmp0@gmail.com. Thanks.
